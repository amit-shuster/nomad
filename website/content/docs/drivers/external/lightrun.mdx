# Lightrun Driver

Name: `lightrun-java`

The Lightrun Nomad driver is used to execute Java applications packaged into a
Java Jar file and automatically add the Lightrun agent to them.

[Lightrun][lightrun_website] is a developer-native observability platform. With
Lightrun you can add logs, snapshots (virtual breakpoints), and metrics to
production applications without the need for redeployments or restarts. You can
use Lightrun directly from your IDE or CLI to observe, understand and debug
your application at runtime.

Refer to the [Lightrun documentation][lightrun_docs] for more information about
Lightrun.

## Prerequisites

1. Download or clone the [Lightrun driver repository][repo].
1. Find the `lightrun-java-driver` driver in the repository's root folder.
1. Copy the driver to your Nomad plugins directory (or create one if it doesn't
  exist).
1. Grant executable permissions to the driver file:

    ```shell-session
    $ chmod +x ./plugins/lightrun-java-driver
    ```

1. When running the Nomad agent, make sure to specify the path to your plugins
  directory:

    ```shell-session
    $ sudo nomad agent -dev -bind 0.0.0.0 -log-level DEBUG -plugin-dir=<path_to_plugins_directory>
    ```

## Task Configuration

```hcl
task "run-with-lightrun" {
  driver = "lightrun-java"

  config {
    lightrun_server = "https://app.lightrun.com/company/<COMPANY-NAME>"
    lightrun_secret = "<COMPANY-SECRET>"
    lightrun_certificate = "ee80811b38e7e6c2dc4cc372cbea86bd86b446b012e427f2e19bf094afba5d12"
  }
}
```

The `lightrun-java` driver accepts all configuration options of the Nomad
[`java`] driver.

Additionaly, the `lightrun-java` driver supports the following configuration in
the job spec:

- `lightrun_server` -
- `lightrun_secret` -
