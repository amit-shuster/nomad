# Lightrun Driver

Name: `lightrun-java`

The Lightrun Nomad driver is used to execute Java applications packaged into a Java Jar file and automatically add the Lightrun agent to them.

[Lightrun](https://www.lightrun.com) is a developer-native observability platform. With Lightrun you to add logs, snapshots (virtual breakpoints), and metrics to production applications without the need for redeployments or restarts. You can use Lightrun directly from your IDE or CLI to observe, understand and debug your application at runtime.

See [Lightrun documentation](https://docs.lightrun.com/) for more information about Lightrun.

## Prerequisites

1. Clone the driver's repository: `git clone https://github.com/lightrun-platform/lightrun-n-nomad`
1. Find `lightrun-java-driver` driver on the root folder of the repository.
1. Copy the driver to your Nomad plugins directory (or create one if not exists)
1. Grant executable permissions to the driver file: `chmod +x ./plugins/lightrun-java-driver`
1. When running the Nomad's agent, make sure to specify the path to your plugins directory:

    ```sh
    sudo nomad agent -dev -bind 0.0.0.0 -log-level DEBUG -plugin-dir=<path_to_plugins_directory>
    ```

## Task Configuration

The `lightrun-java` driver accepts all configuration options of the Nomad [`java`](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/drivers/java) driver.

1. Add `lightrun-java` as a driver to your job file.
1. Set `lightrun_server`, `lightrun_secret` and `lightrun_certificate` as part of the config object.

For example:

```hcl
task "run-with-lightrun" {
   driver = "lightrun-java"

   ...

   config {
      ...
      lightrun_server = "https://app.lightrun.com/company/<COMPANY-NAME>"
      lightrun_secret = "<COMPANY-SECRET>"
      lightrun_certificate = "ee80811b38e7e6c2dc4cc372cbea86bd86b446b012e427f2e19bf094afba5d12"
   }
}
```

A full job file example can be found at `example/example.driver.nomad`

Lightrun's driver will use the arguments given on the config and will automatically download the Lightrun's agent and use it.
